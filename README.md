# Overview

{The software that I have create is a basic Quiz app that uses a loop to ask questions to the user and the receive an input to score on the quiz. It handles if the user does not use a number or a number out of the range (1-4). At the end the quiz displays the users score and the program uses classes to do all of this.}

{I wrote this program because I wanted to create a program that used loops and I also wanted to practice with ways that I can handle errors on user input so that I can make sure to get the desired input from the user with the answer boundaries.}

# Development Environment

{The tools I used to create this program were visual studio code for my IDE but I was able to practice a bit on IntelliJ and it turned out to be the supporting IDE for C#}

{C# is a language that is used because it has a simple syntax compared to Java and C++ but looks and works similarly. It is very good at being specific about data types which is something that I really like about it!}
